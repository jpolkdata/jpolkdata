## About Me

I have over a decade of experience working in data roles within the healthcare industry. My passion for technology and continuous learning has led me to pursue cloud certifications and expand my knowledge in data engineering. In my free time, I enjoy experimenting with home automation and working on projects in my home lab to further develop my skills.
