## About Me

Hey there! I'm a data engineer and a guy who just loves technology in general. I have over a decade of experience working in data roles within the healthcare industry to support value-based care initiatives. I love working with data, and I'm also working on actively building out my skills in cloud technologies.

Most of my coding and architectural work is done...at work :D So I tend to work in this space on an irregular basis. However, I use this space as a way to test out new tools and smaller personal projects that don't make sense to do at work. There's a mixture of notes, demos, POCs, as well as small projects I'm playing with to help make my life easier.

In my free time I enjoy experimenting with home automation and working on projects in my home lab. Some things I've recently worked on at home include:
- Building a new Unraid server: This is initially meant to serve my media, document storage and backup needs. It will also allow me to start running my own Dockers/VMs etc and I plan to start playing with Home Assistant and learning how to automate my home life.
- 3D printing: I recently picked up a SOVOL SV06 printer and have been learning the ins-and-outs of how it works. Configuring and tweaking the printer has proven to be a whole hobby in itself!
