## About Me

Hey there! I'm a data engineer who also likes to play with technology. 

I use this profile as a way to test out new tools and work on some personal projects separate from my day job. There's a mixture of notes, demos, POCs, as well as small projects I'm playing with to help make my life easier.

I have over a decade of experience working in data roles within the healthcare industry. I love working with data, and I'm also working on building out my skills in cloud technologies.

In my free time I enjoy experimenting with home automation and working on projects in my home lab to further develop my skills.
