## About Me

Hey there! I'm a data engineer and a guy who just loves technology in general. I have over a decade of experience working in data roles within the healthcare industry to support value-based care initiatives. I love working with data, and I'm also working on actively building out my skills in cloud technologies.

I use this space as needed to try out things that don't make sense to do at work or for personal projects . There's a mixture of notes, demos, POCs, as well as small projects I'm playing with to help make my life easier.

In my free time some of my hobbies include 3D printing, self-hosting, home automation, and reading.
